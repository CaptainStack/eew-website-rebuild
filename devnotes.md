# EEW Website Devnotes

* The site sometimes will refuse to build for various reasons - if that happens try deleting .cache
* If you are failing to see changes made live (hot reloaded), try clearing your browser cache with a hard refresh (usually ctrl + shift + r). If that doesn't work try stopping and rerunning `npm run develop`
* Do not use inline styles as they will compete with the styles in .css and .scss files
